# GeneticAlgorithms
In this project I use genetic algorithms to solve two problems: 
* I want to arrange 8 queens in a chessboard without any of them being in the line of attack of the other queens on the board;
* Solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

Through testing i have found the pros and cons of using genetic algorithms to try and solve these types of challenges, having solved the Queens problem, however also understanding why trying to solve a sudoku puzzle using this technology is disadvantageous.
